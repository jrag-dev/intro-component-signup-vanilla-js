## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- JavaScript
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

With this project I was able to practice what I have learned about HTML, CSS and JavaScript, paying close attention to the semantics of HTML and Applying CSS Flexbox and Grid, as well as using CSS positioning.

### Continued development

One way to improve the project would be adding data dynamically, and maybe using some javascript framework like Vue, React, Angular or Svelte.
